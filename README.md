#BackboneCollectionTable

This is a [Backbone.View](http://backbonejs.org/#View) table represention of a [Backbone.Collection](http://backbonejs.org/#Collection) that renders as an HTML table.  It was based on [EditableGrid](http://www.editablegrid.net/), a wonderful javascript library to create dynamic tables.  Upon building apps using Backbone, eventually I couldn't do what was needed in EditableGrid and designed one to tie more directly to Backbone and I did not try to replicate all of the features of EditableGrid. 

After using this in a few different projects, it came time to split this out separately.
